Design:

The concept behind my game is a simple dungeon crawler based on someone dreaming. This isn’t made aware to the user until the game is won. 

The player starts the game in a room at the end of a hallway, confused as to how they got there. A booming voice gives them directions on what they have to do to return home. 

The goal of the game is to find a “key”(a gem) and answer the voices riddles (2 of them).

The player has 8 turns (“hours”) to accomplish the goal.

The player will have 5 choices for each round:

1.	Look around (interact with space)
2.	Move to an adjacent space (pointer manipulation)
3.	Print list of items (use doubly linked list)
4.	Print remaining steps (each move  to an adjacent space counts as a step)
5.	Quit the game

Required items:
1.	Need torch from hallway to get across snakepit
2.	Need gem (key) from snakepit to access the puzzle room

Puzzles/Riddles:

1.	In a certain country ½ of 5 = 3. If the same proportion holds, what is the value of 1/3 of 10 ?
Answer: 4 (5/2 = 3 | 5=6 | 5/3 = 2 10/3 = 4)

2.	What digit is the least frequent between the numbers 1 and 1,000 (0-9)
Answer: 0
